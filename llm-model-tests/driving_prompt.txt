You are analyzing a dashcam image.

Your current speed is 0.
Your current steering angle is 0.

Describe ONLY what is clearly visible in the image.

Return your answer EXACTLY in the following structured format.
Do not add extra sections.
Do not change the section names.
If a category is not present, write "None".

1. **Traffic Lights**:
   - State color (red/yellow/green) and position (left/right/center/background).
   - If none visible, write: None

2. **Traffic Signs**:
   - List each visible sign:
     - Type (stop sign, yield sign, speed limit, pedestrian crossing, no turn, etc.)
     - Relative position (right side of road, overhead, near intersection, sidewalk left, etc.)
   - If none visible, write: None

3. **Vehicles**:
   - Total vehicle count: <number>
   - List each vehicle as:
     - Type (car, truck, SUV, bus, motorcycle, etc.)
     - Relative position (front, left lane, right lane, oncoming, parked right side, behind, etc.)

4. **Pedestrians**:
   - Total pedestrian count: <number>
   - For each pedestrian:
     - Relative position (crosswalk, sidewalk right, near intersection, etc.)
   - If none visible, write: None

5. **Lane Markings**:
   - Describe visible lane lines (solid, dashed, double yellow, crosswalk, turn arrows, ONLY markings, etc.)
   - If none visible, write: None

6. **Driving Action**:
   - Steering Angle: <integer>
   - Speed Change: <integer>

For "Steering Angle", allow a range of -180 to 180. Negative is left, Positive is right, 0 is straight.
For "Speed Change", allow a range of -100 to 100. Negative is slow down, Positive is speed up, 0 is maintain.
Output ONLY the integer value for these fields. Do NOT include the explanation text.
If no action is needed, use 0.
